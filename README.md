# AkinaEcho
This is a passion project I did in a couple of days. I used React + TailwindCSS for frontend and Flask for backend. I scraped spotify data of about 12,000 songs including their metadata and cleaned it. Then, I trained a KNN model to be able to get the most similar songs to a given song from the dataset.

The way AkinaEcho works is that each day, there is 1 random question song and 4 most similar songs compared on parameters such as "danceability", "acousticness", and more. Players try to choose the MOST similar one by first listening to song snippets.
